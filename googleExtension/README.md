This "google extension" designed project is called "cLocked In". It was designed so that I can 'clock-in' a 'shift', where the shifts would just represent a task that I am setting for myself. Once this task is clocked in, a timer will start, showing how long you have been working on the task for.

This project was done in a few hours with pure CSS, HTML and JS, and done so I could practice basic Front-End skills. It auto-renders and updates continuously as data is stored on local storage so it is viable to be used as a google extension (didn't upload due to $5 fee).
