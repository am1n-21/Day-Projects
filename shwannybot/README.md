This was my first ever project from the beginning of 2025. It was a discord bot made for my own personal/friends server. It was able to track and log how long users would spend in a VC (at most times), and also had other features such as a 'To-Watch' list. 

It was primarily made just to practice implementing basic Python I had learned over the holidays, and to pick up a new skill of using a sqLite3 database to store VC times.
